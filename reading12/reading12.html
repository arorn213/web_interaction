<img src="reuse.jpg" width="800" height="300" >

<p>Can software takeover the real world? <br>
Today with the introductions such as <em>virtual reality<br>
we all our perceiving alternative realities which might be<br>
amusing but at the same time are stripping us off of personal<br>
firsthand experiences. Its crazy how today the Louvre, in<br>

In this age of technology, our realities seem distorted within spaces.
