<h2> WHAT IS CODE?</h2>

<p>The reading sparked my interest <br>
especially understanding <em> universal visual language </em> <br>
for a webpage. As designers it not only important to consider <br>
 visual appearance but also how one can easily understand the cues.<br>
Thus, I would like to question that <br>
 <strong> How can I as a designer make sure that the user sees  <br>
what i see>? How can understand and implement user experience in my design? </strong><br>
