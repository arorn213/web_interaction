<h1>READING 2</h1><br>
<h3> WHAT IS CODE?</h1><br>
<img src="read2.jpg" width="600" height="333" >

<p>The reading sparked my interest <br>
especially understanding <em> what code actually means? </em> <br>
I was most drawn codes language as a form of art <br>
especially when understanding the interface of a website <br>
Thus, I would like to question that <br>
 <strong> How can I as a designer understand the different perspectives <br>
in coding? And how can code be understood as a form of art? </strong><br>
