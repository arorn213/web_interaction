<h2> WEBSITE AS A PLANT</h2>
<img src="growth.jpg" width="480" height="320" >

<p>The reading by <em>Laurel Schwulst,</em> was really interesting <br>
especially the way in which she metaphorically explains <br>
what a website is. <br>
I was most drawn to her reference of a website as a plant.<br>
Her expression of how our websites require patience and <br>
creativity to evolve and be successful, makes me <br>
question that <strong> how can I as a designer express my practice <br>
and process through mediums of web interaction and <br>
to what extent will this class aid me on those subjects? </strong><br>
