<h1>READING 1</h1><br>
<h3> WEBSITE AS A PLANT</h1><br>
<img src="growth.jpg" width="320" height="333" >

<p>The reading by <em>Laurel Schwulst,</em> was really interesting <br>
especially the way in which she metaphorically explains <br>
what a website is. <br>
I was most drawn to her reference of a website as a plant.<br>
Her expression of how our websites require patience and <br>
creativity to evolve and be successful, I would like to <br>
question that <strong> how can I as a designer express my practice <br>
and process through mediums of web interaction and <br>
to extent will this class aid me on subjects? </strong><br>
