<h1>READING 3</h1><br>
<h3> Websites as a genre</h1><br>


<p>The reading sparked my interest <br>
especially understanding <em> how websites are more like selecting a genre for information </em> <br>
The personification of a website similar to humans <br>
especially when understanding the how we  <br>
evaluate,  criticize, “link” to each other, and ultimately, develop a “taste” <br>
makes me questions that <strong> to what extent can we as designers <br>
work our way through adapting to changing technology ?</strong><br>
