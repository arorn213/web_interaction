<p> I believe, that the crux of this reading got me thinking <br>
peoples thinking of a website to be like a machine or piece of <em>smart technology</em><br>
However, through our own experiences even being in a web design class <br>
we realize that the developer has actually hand written all the code and fed it to to computer.<br>
In this day and age of modern technology, <br>
<strong> how do websites retain its natural feel?  <br> </strong>
