<h4>INGREDIENTS FOR CILANTRO CHICKEN</h4>

<p>Not only does this lime chicken comes together in about 30 minutes but it is also <br>
made with less than 10 ingredients. </p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Chicken:</strong> I love using chicken thighs instead of breast as they are smaller, <br>
juicier, and take less time to grill. </li> <br>
<li> <strong>Cilantro:</strong> fresh cilantro adds so much flavor.</li> <br>
<li> <strong>Limes:</strong>  you will need fresh lime juice and zest.</li> <br>
<li> <strong>Garlic:</strong>  garlic adds ton of flavor and pairs amazing with lime and cilantro.</li> <br>
</ul>

<h4>HOW TO MAKE CILANTRO LIME CHICKEN RECIPE</h4>

<p>What I love best about this cilantro chicken is that the ingredients are super basic <br>
and you can easily double or even triple the recipe.</p>


<ul>
<li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> First prepare the marinade by combining cilantro, garlic, lime zest, lime <br> 
juice, salt, cumin, and olive oil. Add chicken to the marinade and let stand at <br>
room temperature for 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, prepare the salsa.</li> <br>
<li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, avocado, onions, lime juice, olive oil, <br>
and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gentry toss together and set aside. </li><br>
<li> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Pre-heat gas grill on high heat. Clean and oil the grates. When hot, <br>
 add chicken thighs and cook for 10-12 minutes (about 4-5 minutes per each side) or <br>
 until cooked through. You will notice the thighs start to shrink and plump up <br>
 when they are done. Remove to a serving platter and serve alongside avocado salsa. </li> <br>
 </ul>
