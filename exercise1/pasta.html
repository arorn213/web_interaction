artichokes or olives.</li> <br>

box for specific directions. But basically, you will want to cook the pasta in salted  <br>
water until al dente. Cooking time will depend on the type of pasta used.</li> <br>
<li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, in a food processor, pulse the tomatoes and <br>
their oil until chopped. Add garlic, basil, and red pepper flakes, and pulse until <br> 
the mixture resembles paste like consistency. Don not forget to season with salt and pepper.</li><br>
<li> <strong>Step 3:</strong> When pasta is ready, reserve 1 cup of cooking liquid and drain the rest. </li> <br>
<li> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Return the pasta back to heat and add spinach, sun-dried tomato pesto, <br>
