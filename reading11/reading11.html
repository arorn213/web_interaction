<p>This reading helps me give value to memes. <br>
It helps me think how memes can be <em>culturally<br>
powerful but also very different. For example, political memes in <br>
countries like Turkey, can also be held against citizens. <br>
However, with the fast moving pace of technology, memes are the most<br>
contemporary way of spreading political messages across millennials.
