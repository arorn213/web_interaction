<h2> IN DEFENSE OF THE POOR IMAGE</h2>
<img src="pixel.jpg" width="550" height="400" >

<p> <em>This readings,</em> helps me understand that an images poor quality, <br>
is within its real conditions of existence on the web. <br>
It speaks to me as I have never really thought of image <br>
solution changing due to swarm circulation.<br>
However, in this age of file sharing how can we find beauty in pixels?<br>
<strong> Does all good design look diserable only if its in high quality?<br> </strong>
